# PascalsTriangle

Javascript demonstration.

This application will validate several inputs (2 operands, an operator, and an exponent) from the user and from it:

1. Render Pascal's triangle using an algorithm up to appropriate level based on the exponent.
2. Use an algorithm, and the output of Pascal's triangle to create a binomial expansion, creating a preliminary formula.
3. Simplify the formula.

Several concepts are explored: arrays, data type conflicts, regular expressions, and string manipulation.

Unit testing is achieved through the use of Mocha/Chai.

Components:
1. jsDemo2.html: All UI elements are contained here.
2. jsDemo2.js: Main script containining all JavaScript functions.
3. test.html: Unit test runner.
4. test.js: Test script.
